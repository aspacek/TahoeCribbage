Flush Odds

Computing odds with simulations.

52 cards in the deck.

Tahoe points per card hand = 1
Tahoe points for upcard hand = 1
Tahoe points per card crib = 1

Regular Cribbage

ntrials = 1000000

Drawing 6 random cards, seeing how many 4-card flushes we get.
Also checking with upcard.
Also discarding 2 random cards from each hand into crib to check for flushes with upcard.

Hand 1 flushes = 114008 = 11.4008 %
Hand 1 upcard flushes = 20148 = 2.0148 % = 17.6724 % of flushes

Hand 2 flushes = 114837 = 11.48 %
Hand 2 upcard flushes = 20684 = 2.0684 % = 18.0116 % of flushes

Crib 2 flushes = 1872 = 0.1872 %

Hand 1 avg flush points per hand assuming always going for flush = 0.476180
Hand 2 avg flush points per hand assuming always going for flush = 0.480032
Crib 2 avg flush points per hand assuming random discards = 0.009360

Tahoe Cribbage

ntrials = 1000000

Drawing 9 random cards, seeing how many 7-card flushes we get.
Also checking with upcard.
Also putting 3 cards from deck into crib,
and discarding 2 random cards from each hand into crib to check for flushes with upcard.

Hand 1 flushes = 1451 = 0.1451 %
Hand 1 upcard flushes = 175 = 0.0175 % = 12.0606 % of flushes

Hand 2 flushes = 1408 = 0.1408 %
Hand 2 upcard flushes = 207 = 0.0207 % = 14.7017 % of flushes

Crib 2 flushes = 9 = 0.000900 %

Hand 1 avg flush points per hand assuming always going for flush = 0.010332
Adjusted value = 0.010332
Hand 2 avg flush points per hand assuming always going for flush = 0.010063
Adjusted value = 0.010063
Crib 2 avg flush points per hand assuming random discards = 0.0000720
Adjusted value = 0.0000720

Comparisons:
Hand 1 normal avg / Tahoe avg = 46.09
Hand 2 normal avg / Tahoe avg = 47.70
Crib 2 normal avg / Tahoe avg = 130.00

Hand 1 normal avg / Tahoe adjusted avg = 46.09
Hand 2 normal avg / Tahoe adjusted avg = 47.70
Crib 2 normal avg / Tahoe adjusted avg = 130.00

Tahoe Cribbage - Only 5 Cards Required

ntrials = 1000000

Drawing 9 random cards, seeing how many >=5-card flushes we get.
Also checking with upcard.
Also putting 3 cards from deck into crib,
and discarding 2 random cards from each hand into crib to check for flushes with upcard.

Hand 1 flushes = 133485 = 13.3485 %
Hand 1 upcard flushes = 22486 = 2.2486 % = 16.8453 % of flushes

Hand 2 flushes = 133628 = 13.3628 %
Hand 2 upcard flushes = 22437 = 2.2437 % = 16.7906 % of flushes

Crib 2 flushes = 4997 = 0.499700 %

Hand 1 avg flush points per hand assuming always going for flush = 0.709809
Adjusted value = 0.709809
Hand 2 avg flush points per hand assuming always going for flush = 0.710543
Adjusted value = 0.710543
Crib 2 avg flush points per hand assuming random discards = 0.0252800
Adjusted value = 0.0252800

Comparisons:
Hand 1 normal avg / Tahoe avg = 0.67
Hand 2 normal avg / Tahoe avg = 0.68
Crib 2 normal avg / Tahoe avg = 0.37

Hand 1 normal avg / Tahoe adjusted avg = 0.67
Hand 2 normal avg / Tahoe adjusted avg = 0.68
Crib 2 normal avg / Tahoe adjusted avg = 0.37

NOTES:
* I think requiring 5 or more cards for a flush is the way to go.
* Flushes are more likely, but that's better than being impossible.
